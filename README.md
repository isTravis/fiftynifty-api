# Introduction

This API provides full access to the Fifty Nifty database.

# Running Locally

First, create a `config.js` file to configure the PostgreSQL URI. See `config.sample.js` for an example.

Then run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

The Frontend used along with this API is available at [https://github.com/isTravis/fiftynifty](https://github.com/isTravis/fiftynifty).
